[#eventing-source]
== Event Source

The event source listens to external events e.g. a kafka topic or for a file on a FTP server. It is responsible to drain the received event(s) along with its data to a configured https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sink_(computing)[sink].

apiVersion: sources.eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: CronJobSource #<1>
metadata:

spec:

  data: '{"message": "Thanks for doing the Knative Tutorial"}'

    kind: Service
    name: event-greeter #<2>
----

<1> The type of event source, the eventing system deploys a bunch of sources out of the box and it also provides way to deploy custom resources
<2> The service(sink) where the event data will be sent

[NOTE]
====
Event Source can define the attributes that it wishes to receive via the 
spec.  In the above example it defines **schedule**(the the cron expression) and **data** that will be sent as part of the event.

When you xref:{eventing-repo}/eventing.adoc#eventing-watch-logs[watch logs], you will notice this data being delivered to the service.
====

Run the following commands to create the event source resources:

:doc-sec: event-src-svc
:url: {github-repo}/{eventing-repo}/knative/event-source-svc.yaml
:url-alt-text: event-source-svc.yaml

====
If you have skipped the xref:ROOT:{build-repo}/build.adoc[Build] or xref:ROOT:05-build/build-templates.adoc[Build Templates] and dont have the container image of `event-greeter`; then you can update the Knative serving service to use the pre-built event-greeter image available at `quay.io/rhdevelopers/knative-tutorial-greeter:0.0.1`
