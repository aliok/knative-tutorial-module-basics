[#eventing-channel]
== Channel(Sink)

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture#Event_channel[channel or sink] is an interface between the <<eventing-source,event source>> and the <<eventing-subscriber,subscriber>>.The channels are built in to store the incoming events and distribute the event data to the subscribers. When forwarding event to subscribers the channel transforms the event data as per http://cloudevents.io[CloudEvent] specification.

[#eventing-source]
== Event Source

The event source listens to external events e.g. a kafka topic or for a file on a FTP server. It is responsible to drain the received event(s) along with its data to a configured https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sink_(computing)[sink].

<1> The type of event source, the eventing system deploys a bunch of sources out of the box and it also provides way to deploy custom resources

[NOTE,subs="macros+"]
====
Event Source can define the attributes that it wishes to receive via the 
spec.  In the above example it defines **schedule**(the the cron expression) and **data** that will be sent as part of the event.

When you xref:{eventing-repo}/eventing.adoc#eventing-watch-logs[watch logs], you will notice this data being delivered to the service.
====

Run the following commands to create the event source resources:

[#eventing-subscriber]
== Event Subscriber

The event subscription is responsible of connecting the channel(sink) with the service. Once a service connected to a channel it starts receiving the events (cloud events).
