== How to access the Knative services ?

When looking up the IP address to use for accessing your app, you need to look up the NodePort for the **istio-ingressgateway** as well as the IP address used for minikube. You can use the following command to look up the value to use for the pass:[{IP_ADDRESS}] placeholder used in the sample
[source,bash,linenums]
----
#!/bin/bash
# In Knative 0.2.x and prior versions, the `knative-ingressgateway` service was used instead of `istio-ingressgateway`.
INGRESSGATEWAY=knative-ingressgateway

# The use of `knative-ingressgateway` is deprecated in Knative v0.3.x.
# Use `istio-ingressgateway` instead.
if kubectl get configmap config-istio -n knative-serving &> /dev/null; then
    INGRESSGATEWAY=istio-ingressgateway
fi

IP_ADDRESS="$(minikube ip):$(kubectl get svc $INGRESSGATEWAY --namespace istio-system --output 'jsonpath={.spec.ports[?(@.port==80)].nodePort}')"

# calling a knative service named greeter
curl -H "Host:greeter.knativetutorial.example.com" $IP_ADDRESS

== What is a "revision" in simpler terms?
A https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/docs/spec/overview.md#revision[Revision] is an immutable snapshot of code and configuration. Each change to an application's https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/docs/spec/overview.md#configuration[Configuration] creates a new *Revision*, which allows an application to be rolled back to any previous “known good configuration”.
